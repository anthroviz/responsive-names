# responsive-names

idea here is sometimes we use reductive names / elusion to describe information about ourselves based on the context. the context considered is usually social; the reasons may be temporal, or for privacy (e.g., XYZ doesn't need to know what exactly is going on with this complex bit of my identity... it's quicker and sufficient to use this approximation; if we become closer, i feel more comfortable with disclosing more)

want to use the literal structure of responsive webpages' `media-queries` to play with these approximations.
